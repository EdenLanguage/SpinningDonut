# üç© Spinning ASCII Donut in Eden

Showcase of **spinning ASCII donut** animation implemented in [Eden](https://github.com/EdenLanguage/Eden), my custom programming language. I wanted to prove that you can actually build something in Eden - and classic ASCII donut felt just right.

## üé• Demo

<img src="Assets/SpinningDonut.gif" alt="Spinning donut demo" style="width: 100%;">

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to the performance of Eden language, generating frames may take some time. The animation might run slower depending on your system.

## üöÄ How to Run

To run the demo, you'll need to have [Eden](https://github.com/EdenLanguage/Eden) installed on your local machine.

Once it's installed:
1. Clone this repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EdenLanguage/SpinningDonut
```
2. Navigate to folder:
```bash
cd SpinningDonut
```
3. Run program:
```bash
eden main.eden
```
4. Enjoy üòâ
